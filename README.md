#### About
A GameBoy emulator written in Java. This is mostly an exercise for me to learn.

I'm not really concerned about performance, but I am going to try to make it as performant as I can.

This also includes a disassembler, which I'm pretty sure I don't need for a functioning emulator, but like I said this is for learning purposes. And boy howdy was that an experience.
