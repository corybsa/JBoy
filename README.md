# JBoy

#### About
A GameBoy emulator written in Java. This is mostly an exercise for me to learn.

I'm not really concerned about performance, but I am going to try to make it as performant as I can.

This also includes a disassembler, which I'm pretty sure I don't need for a functioning emulator, but like I said this is for learning purposes. And boy howdy was that an experience.

#### Usage
Right now, all that works is the disassembler. All you need to do is choose "Disassemble..." from the menu and it will ask for a ROM file.

I'm pretty sure it will crash if you choose a file that's not a GameBoy ROM file since I'm not doing any checks.

No, I'm not including any ROM file in this repository. I'm sure you can find them somewhere on the internet.
